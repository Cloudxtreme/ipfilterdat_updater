===================

This is a Linux script that automates operations of retrieve and merge several ipfilter.dat files

**Now it DEPENDS on ZENITY for the GUI**

If you want to use it: 
- Open file with a text editor and modify "destdir" variable from "~/.aMule" to "/whatever/you-want/directory"
- Assign executable permission to the script
- Execute it
- Enjoy you 800000+ ipfilter ;)
